# Talent Village Coding Test: ReactNative Engineer

**Please upload this project to your preferred source control platform and share with Model Village. Place your work inside the `/test` folder**

We’d like to see how you approach this challenge, and what process you take, so please aim to push regular commits to the repository as you work through the task.

For this coding test, we’d like you to build out the interface as shown (minimum card list and sheet) in the assets folder as a ReactNative application.

The app should allow a user to view a list of cards with an image, title and a description. Tapping on an avatar should open a sheet modal that displays the users avatar and stats that can be swiped down or tapped outside the container to close.

You should:

* Use ReactNative.
* Demonstrate handling data through API calls. Faking this is fine for the purposes of this demonstration.
* Allow the user to click from feed to details
* Alter the design as needed to leave your mark
